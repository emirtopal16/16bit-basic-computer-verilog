# 16bit-basic-computer-verilog
This project involves the RTL design and simulation of a 16-bit Von Neumann architecture computer using Verilog HDL. The design is constructed from modular components including a comprehensive Datapath, Memory Unit, and a standalone Controller. The Datapath features a bus-based system connecting the Program Counter (PC), Address Register (AR), Instruction Register (IR), and a custom Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of logic, arithmetic, and shifting operations. The controller is designed to decode and execute memory-reference, register-reference, and I/O instructions. The entire design was validated through extensive simulations using Cocotb to verify correct instruction cycles and interrupt handling.
